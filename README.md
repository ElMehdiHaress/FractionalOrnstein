# FractionalOrnstein
Let the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a fractional Brownian motion be observed at discrete time instants. We propose an ergodic type statistical estimator to estimate all the parameters  in the above model simultaneously. We prove the strong consistence and the rate of convergence of the estimator. The step size h can be arbitrarily fixed and will not be forced to go zero, which is usually a reality. The tools we use are the generalized moment approach (via ergodic theorem) and the Malliavin calculus.
